This is the version for an unmodified mission row (eg there are no additional modifications such as Community 
Mission Row installed) Please see my other modification, which is designed to replace Community Mission Row (Available

=========================================================

This Mod turns the LSPD mission row police station (which is the GTA V default) into a Metropolitan Police
Station. It is highly requested, so here it is.

There are two versions. This one, which is for an unmodified version of mission row (eg there are no additional
modifications such as Community Mission Row installed) And there is the second one (which you can find on my 
profile) which is for the Community Mission Row Add-on.
